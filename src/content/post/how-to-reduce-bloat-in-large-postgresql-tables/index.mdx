I worked with [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) again to write an article on how table bloat effects large tables, and how we can fix it.

We cover a range of topics including:

<ul class="mt-[-16px] mb-8">
  <li>What is table bloat?</li>
  <li>Why is it an issue?</li>
  <li>How to monitor table bloat?</li>
  <li>What Vacuum and AutoVacuum is</li>
  <li>Tips with tuning AutoVacuum</li>
  <li>Table Partitioning</li>
  <li>How Timescale chunks makes partitioning easier</li>
  <li>And more!</li>
</ul>
