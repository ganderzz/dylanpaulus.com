Databases store an application's most valuable asset: data. This data includes personal information like names, passwords, and street addresses, but it could also include company secrets. Having an insecure database is devastating for a few reasons:

- Leaking personal data erodes trust from users and customers
- Falling share prices or loss of revenue
- You can be hit with regulatory penalties (e.g., GDPR)
- In specific sectors, vulnerabilities can be used to cause physical harm
