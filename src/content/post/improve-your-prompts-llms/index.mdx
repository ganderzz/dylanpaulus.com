Tools like ChatGPT and Bing have been skyrocketing in popularity.
ChatGPT took five days since launch to [reach 1 million users](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1655950701951082497?s=20).
Governments all over the world are trying to [figure out](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14903078) what to do [with this technology](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65139406).
Sweet [AI generated images](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney) are showing up everywhere; like this dog I generated using Bing:

Though LLM's (Large Language Models) are still in their infancy, research has shown some [pretty big productivity boosts](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/secret-cyborgs-the-present-disruption) in range of different professions.
Using metrics from Github Copilot, an AI-based coding tool, Github has found that developers [complete tasks in 55% less time](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/).

This is all to say that LLM's are a tool we'll need to learn to use, and use well.

There are quite a few options for LLM's out there, with the most popular being ChatGPT and Bing.
OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is the most well known, but if we want to use the latest features like ChatGPT-4 (an upgrade to ChatGPT-3) we'll need to pay $20 a month.
Microsoft has released new [Bing](https://www.bing.com/new) that takes advantage of ChatGPT-4 behind the scenes, and is free to use.
Finally, Google has [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) which is also free to use.
All offerings come with their own pros and cons.

Regardless of which tool you use, the question remains: how do we get the most out of these tools?

## Prompt Engineering

We interact with LLM's by giving them a prompt, or text input, generally in the form of a question or instruction.
LLM's then reason out the answer and provide a response.
Prompt Engineering is a term coined to describe the process of writing prompts to get the best results from LLM's.
Just like in everyday conversation, the words we choose to ask in a question can dramatically change the response we get.
For example, if I ask "What is the best way to get to the airport?" I'll get a different response than if I ask "How do I get to the airport?".

Throughout this article we'll build on a prompt to create a meal plan for one day; taking advantage of different Prompt Engineering techniques.
I'll provide the prompt used, and the response I got back from the LLM--in my case I'll be using ChatGPT-3.
Try it for yourself, but remember that the results will vary by the LLM being used.

### Constraints

Just like people, LLM's need constraints and clarity to understand what we're asking.
Be specific when writing prompts, and have a desired outcome in mind.
The best mental model I've been told is to think of LLM's as an intern, brand new to the job.
They need clear and direct instructions, but eager to get stuff done.

### Role prompting, or "Act like a..."

### Few shot prompting

> Act as a professional painter. Generate a picture of a landscape you took at sun set. Include a river running east to west with birds and fish in the river. There is a tall mountain in the background with deep green pine trees. There are deep orange and blue colors caused by the sky and water. The river is calm. Two clouds in the sky of medium size.
