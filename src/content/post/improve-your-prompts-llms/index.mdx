Tools like ChatGPT and Bing have been skyrocketing in popularity.
ChatGPT took five days since launch to [reach 1 million users](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1655950701951082497?s=20).
Governments all over the world are trying to [figure out](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14903078) what to do [with this technology](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65139406).
Sweet [AI-generated images](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney) are showing up everywhere; like this dog I generated using Bing:

  "Can you generate a picture of an astronaut dog jumping over a fire on the
  moon?"

Though LLMs (Large Language Models) are still in their infancy, research has shown some [pretty big productivity boosts](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/secret-cyborgs-the-present-disruption) in a range of different professions.
Using metrics from Github Copilot, an AI-based coding tool, Github has found that developers [complete tasks in 55% less time when taking advantage of AI](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/).

This is all to say that LLMs are a tool we'll need to learn to use and _use well_.

There are many options when choosing a LLM, with the most popular being ChatGPT and Bing.
OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is the most well-known, but if we want to use the latest features like ChatGPT-4 (an upgrade to ChatGPT-3) we'll need to pay $20 a month.
Microsoft has released new [Bing](https://www.bing.com/new) that takes advantage of ChatGPT-4 behind the scenes and is free to use.
Finally, Google has [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) which is also free to use.
All offerings come with their unique pros and cons.

Regardless of which tool you use, the question remains: how do we get the most out of these tools?

## Prompt Engineering

We interact with LLMs by giving them a prompt, or text input, generally in the form of a question or instruction.
LLMs then reason out the answer and respond.
Prompt Engineering is a term coined to describe the process of writing prompts to get the best results from LLMs.
Just like in everyday conversation, the words we choose to ask in a question can dramatically change the response we get.
For example, if I ask ‚ÄúWhat is the best way to get to the airport?‚Äù I‚Äôll get a different response than asking ‚ÄúHow do I get to the airport?‚Äú.

Throughout this article we‚Äôll build on a prompt to create a meal plan for a single day; taking advantage of different Prompt Engineering techniques.
I‚Äôll provide the prompt used, and the response I got back from the LLM‚Äîin my case I‚Äôll be using ChatGPT-3.
Try it for yourself, but remember that the results will vary by the LLM being used.

### Constraints

Just like people, LLMs need constraints and clarity to understand what's being asking.
Be specific when writing prompts, and have a desired outcome in mind.
The best mental model I've been told is to think of LLMs as an intern, brand new to the job.
They are eager to get stuff done, but need clear and direct instructions.
The best way to get the best results out of LLMs is to be specific.

Let's improve upon our prompt by adding some constraints.

<section class="full-bleed">
<div class="lg:flex justify-between gap-4 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4">
<Prompt header="Prompt" className="w-full lg:w-1/2">
  Please create me a low sugar meal plan for one day. The plan should be a
  maximum 1,800 calories, and do not include breakfast. No gluten. High in
  protein.
</Prompt>

<Prompt header="ü§ñ (LLM) Response" className="w-full lg:w-1/2" isResponse>
**Low-Sugar, Gluten-Free, High-Protein Meal Plan for One Day**

**Lunch**

- Grilled chicken breast (4 oz)

**Dessert**

- Mixed berries (1 cup) with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream

  _Note:_ Please note that portion sizes and specific calorie counts may
  vary depending on the size and brand of the ingredients used. Adjust the
  portion sizes and consult a healthcare professional or a registered
  dietitian for any specific dietary needs or concerns.

### Role prompting, or "Act like a..."

Role Prompting or "Act like a ..." is a technique that can be used to provide more context and constraints to LLMs.
First we tell the LLM to assume a role or persona. Then we provide a prompt.
For example, if we had a question about woodworking we might say, `"Act like a master woodworker. What is the best way to cut a dovetail joint?"`.
Role prompting is another great way to provide constraints to LLMs.

Let's improve upon our meal plan prompt by adding a role.

<section class="full-bleed">
<div class="lg:flex justify-between gap-4 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4">
<Prompt header="Prompt" className="w-full lg:w-1/2">
  Act as an expert nutritionist with 20 years of experience. Please create me a
  low sugar meal plan for one day. The plan should be a maximum 1,800 calories,
  and do not include breakfast. No gluten. High in protein.
</Prompt>

<Prompt header="ü§ñ (LLM) Response" className="w-full lg:w-1/2" isResponse>
**Low Sugar Meal Plan**

**Maximum 1,800 Calories | No Gluten | High in Protein**

**Lunch**

- Grilled chicken breast (4 oz) seasoned with herbs and spices
- Quinoa salad with mixed vegetables (such as bell peppers, cucumbers, and cherry
  tomatoes) dressed with lemon juice and olive oil
- Steamed broccoli (1 cup) -
  Mixed greens salad with avocado slices and a light vinaigrette dressing
- Sparkling water with a squeeze of fresh lemon

**Snack**

- Greek yogurt (6 oz) topped with mixed berries (such as strawberries and
  blueberries)
- Handful of unsalted almonds

**Dinner**

- Baked salmon fillet (4 oz) marinated in a mix of lemon juice, garlic, and dill
- Roasted Brussels sprouts with garlic and olive oil (1 cup)
- Steamed asparagus (1 cup)
- Quinoa (1/2 cup) cooked with vegetable broth
- Herbal tea or water with a slice of lemon

**Evening Snack**

- Celery sticks and carrot sticks with hummus
- Green tea or water

This meal plan is designed to be low in added sugars and gluten-free while
providing ample protein from lean sources like chicken, fish, and Greek
yogurt. It incorporates a variety of colorful vegetables, healthy fats from
avocado and olive oil, and whole grains like quinoa for additional fiber.
Remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated.

Please note that this is a generalized meal plan, and it's always a good idea to consult with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who can create a personalized meal plan based on your specific dietary needs and health goals.

### Few shot prompting

Few shot prompting is my favorite technique, and can really take the performance of LLMs to the next level.
First we provide the LLM with a few examples (or shots) of what we want, and then we ask the LLM to generate a similar response (furthering adding constraints to our prompt).
The term "shot" is synonymous with "example". In Pompt Engineering you will also find zero shot prompting and one shot prompting.

- **Zero Shot Prompting:** No examples are provided
- **One Shot Prompting:** One example is provided
- **Few Shot Prompting:** Two or more examples are provided

The shots, or examples, can be given in the same prompt, or broken out into separate prompts.

For example, in our meal plan example we could ask the LLM in a single prompt:

<section class="full-bleed">
<div class="lg:flex justify-between gap-4 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4">
<Prompt header="Prompt">
Use the following examples of a meal plan:

Or ask the LLM to read a few examples first before we ask our question.
To reduce the amount of time needed for the LLM to repond, we can ask it to confirm once it has read the example.

### Conclusion

Compare the first meal plan to the final result. After taking advantage of the prompt engineering techniques we learned, we can see that the last meal plan is much more specific, detailed, and closer to the answer we would expect!

Using constraints, role prompting, and shot prompting, we can improve the quality of our prompts, impress our friends, and increase our productivity.
