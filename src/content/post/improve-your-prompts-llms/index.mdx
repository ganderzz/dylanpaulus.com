Tools like ChatGPT and Bing have been skyrocketing in popularity.
ChatGPT took five days since launch to [reach 1 million users](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1655950701951082497?s=20).
Governments all over the world are trying to [figure out](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14903078) what to do [with this technology](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65139406).
Sweet [AI generated images](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/12/when-ai-can-make-art-what-does-it-mean-for-creativity-dall-e-midjourney) are showing up everywhere; like this dog I generated using Bing:

Though LLM's (Large Language Models) are still in their infancy, research has shown some [pretty big productivity boosts](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/secret-cyborgs-the-present-disruption) in range of different professions.
Using metrics from Github Copilot, an AI-based coding tool, Github has found that developers [complete tasks in 55% less time](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/).

This is all to say that LLM's are a tool we'll need to learn to use, and use well.

There are quite a few options for LLM's out there, with the most popular being ChatGPT and Bing.
OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) is the most well known, but if we want to use the latest features like ChatGPT-4 (an upgrade to ChatGPT-3) we'll need to pay $20 a month.
Microsoft has released new [Bing](https://www.bing.com/new) that takes advantage of ChatGPT-4 behind the scenes, and is free to use.
Finally, Google has [Bard](https://bard.google.com/) which is also free to use.
All offerings come with their own pros and cons.

Regardless of which tool you use, the question remains: how do we get the most out of these tools?

## Prompt Engineering

We interact with LLM's by giving them a prompt in the form of a question or instruction--a prompt instructs the LLM on what to do.
Prompt Engineering is a term coined to describe the process of writing prompts to get the best results from LLM's.
Just like in everyday conversation, the words we choose to ask a question can dramatically change the response we get.

### Constraints

_"Grab me that red stuff?"_ vs. _"Can you bring me the ketchup from the fridge?"_ Which question is more likely to get you the ketchup?
Just like people, LLM's need constraints and clarity to understand what we're asking. Be specific when writing prompts.

### Role prompting, or "Act like a..."

### Few shot prompting
