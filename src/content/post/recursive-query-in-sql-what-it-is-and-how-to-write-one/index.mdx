As developers, querying in PostgreSQL for hierarchical data is difficult. SQL is a declarative programming language, but our brains are trained to think imperatively. Recursive queries using Common Table Expressions (CTE) simplify writing iterative queries and are essential in traversing hierarchical data, like tree or graph structures.

Throughout this article, we'll explore SQL recursive queries with examples, look at optimizing recursive queries, and discuss advanced techniques.
