In [Postgres: The Graph Database You Didn't Know You Had](/posts/postgres-is-a-graph-database) we covered how we can store graph data in a relational database.
We looked at one representation of a graph data structure called an adjacency list--a table with two columns representing how nodes connect.
The two columns are a reference to the <em>source</em> or <em>"from"</em> node to a <em>destiation</em> or <em>"to"</em> node.

An adjacency list is a simple and efficient way to store graph data, but there are many more ways to represent graphs.
In this article we'll explore one of these alternatives called the adjacency matrix.

## Adjacency Matrix

An adjacency matrix is a table with a row and column for each node in the graph (or NxN matrix).
To represent the edges we store a 1 in a column for a connection and a 0 for no connection.
Using the same graph as above, the adjacency matrix would look like this:
