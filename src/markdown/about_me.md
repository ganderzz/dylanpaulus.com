## Hi, I'm Dylan.

My interest in computers started when I was six years old, waking up for Christmas, ripping open a brand new Nintendo 64 gaming console, slamming in the Super Mario 64 cartridge, and seeing the red hat plumber in all his 3D glory. I knew that I wanted to do whatever made this game possible. Ever since then, I have been learning everything I can about software development.

Fast-forward to today, I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Rover.com](https://rover.com).
