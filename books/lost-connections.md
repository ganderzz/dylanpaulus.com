> You need your nausea. It is a message. It will tell us what is wrong with you.

Lost Connections is a challenge to the classic story any of us with depression and anxiety have heard. Go to a doctor. Get anti-depression pills. Become _normal_. Johann doesn't completely remove that fact that medical anti-depressants work, they do; just for a smaller subset of humans than is currently being prescribed. We live in the loneliest age. The internet has made us shelter away from society. During a study participants were asked, "In a crisis, how many close friends could you call?" Years ago the most common answer was five. Today it is **none**. In Lost Connections, Johann travels across the world to talk to leading psycologists and researchers to figure out the leading causes for depression and anxiety. He came across nine symptoms that suggest many of our ailments are societal, not biological.

### Disconnection from Meaningful Work

For many of us, work is 8 hours a week day--1/4<sup>th</sup> of the day. It's no wonder that a lack of autonomy in our jobs, and a lack of real purpose causes depression. Johann mentions that between 2011 and 2012, a polling company Gallup studied millions of workers across 142 countries. They found 13 percent of workers said they were "engaged." 63 percent said they were "not engaged." And finally the remaining 24 percent were "actively disengaged." Which means these workers were not only unhappy with their job, but actively acting out against the other employees and company.

### Disconnection from Other People

### Disconnection from Meaningful Values

### Disconnection from Childhood Trauma

### Disconnection from Status and Respect

### Disconnection from the Natural World

### Disconnection from a Hopeful or Secure Future

### The Role of Genes and Brain Changes

### Thoughts and Conclusion

"You need your nausea. It is a message. It will tell us what is wrong with you." This is what a doctor told Johann after he ate an apple with pesticides on it causing him to almost die. If the doctor just prescribed nausea medication, then Johann would of surely died. It was a symptom, not the illness. Johann describes depression and anxiety exactly in the same terms. We feel terrible, because we need meaning in our lives, we need nature, and we need other people. It's a mourning for natural humanistic needs.

My thoughts is that Lost Connections is an interesting take on the concept of anti-depressants.
